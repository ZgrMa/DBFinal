# DBFinal
A quiz website made as a final project for my databases course. Made with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and uses a Google API for login security. This site allows a user to login, take a quiz which saves their progress, and check if their answers to the quiz are correct.

Removed the configuration and .JSON files for security purposes.
